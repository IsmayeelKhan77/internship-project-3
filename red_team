# Red Team Report — HawkEye Lab
**Author:** Ismayeel khan
**Role:** Red Team (lab)  
**Capture Date:** 2019-04-10

---

## 1 — Executive summary
I worked the HawkEye lab from an attacker perspective and captured the main steps. The victim downloaded a malicious executable (`tkraw_Protected99.exe`) from a suspicious invoice-style domain and the malware exfiltrated collected data via email every 10 minutes. Below are the timeline, findings, and IOCs.

---

## 2 — Objective
- Simulate the attacker: deliver a payload, collect credentials, and exfiltrate data.

---

## 3 — Environment & capture
- **Total packets:** 4003  
- **First packet time:** 2019-04-10 20:37  
- **Capture duration:** 01:03:41  
- **Victim host (most active):** `BEIJING-5CD1-PC`  
- **Most active MAC (link-level):** `00:08:02:1c:47:ae` (Hewlett-Packard)  
- **Organization DNS server:** `10.4.10.4`  
- **Victim public IP (observed):** `173.66.146.112`

---

## 4 — Timeline (high level)
- `2019-04-10 20:37` — capture starts.
- Packet #204 — DNS query for `proforma-invoices.com`.
- HTTP GET observed that downloaded `tkraw_Protected99.exe`.
- Malware ran, collected credentials, and sent them out via email periodically (every 10 minutes).
- Capture ends after ~1 hour.

---

## 5 — Evidence & IOCs
- **Malicious filename:** `tkraw_Protected99.exe`  
- **MD5:** `71826ba081e303866ce2a2534491a2f7`  
- **Malware family (lab):** Reborn v9 (lab ID)  
- **Exfil email:** `sales.del@macwinlogistics.in`  
- **Password seen (in capture):** `Sales@23`  
- **Stolen creds example:** `roman.mcguire:P@ssw0rd$`  
- **Domain (packet 204):** `proforma-invoices.com`  

---

## 6 — What I did (short)
- Opened the PCAP and found the DNS query for the lure domain.  
- Followed the HTTP stream to the downloaded file and noted the filename and hash.  
- Looked for repeated outbound traffic and found periodic email exfiltration.  
- Collected IOCs (domain, email, file hash, victim host/IP).

> **Note:** I saved screenshots: DNS packet, Follow TCP Stream for the download, endpoints stats. I also exported the file hash for the payload. Do NOT execute any binaries.

---

## 7 — Quick attacker behavior summary
- Lure domain used (invoice themed) → user downloads executable → malware runs and collects data → periodic exfil via email every 10 minutes.
