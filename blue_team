# Blue Team Report — HawkEye Lab
**Author:** Ismayeel khan
**Role:** Blue Team (lab)  
**Capture Date:** 2019-04-10

## 1 — Executive summary
This is the defensive write-up for the HawkEye lab. Using the Red Team findings, I listed detections, triage steps, containment and remediation actions to handle the `tkraw_Protected99.exe` incident.

---

## 2 — Short incident recap
- **Victim host:** `BEIJING-5CD1-PC`  
- **Malicious file:** `tkraw_Protected99.exe` (MD5: `71826ba081e303866ce2a2534491a2f7`)  
- **Lure domain:** `proforma-invoices.com`  
- **Exfil method:** email to `sales.del@macwinlogistics.in` every 10 minutes  
- **Stolen credential example:** `roman.mcguire:P@ssw0rd$`

---

## 3 — High priority IOCs (block/monitor)
- Domain: `proforma-invoices.com`  
- Email: `sales.del@macwinlogistics.in`  
- File hash (MD5): `71826ba081e303866ce2a2534491a2f7`  
- Hostname/IP: `BEIJING-5CD1-PC` / `173.66.146.112`

---

## 4 — Detection searches
(If you use Splunk, ELK, or similar, adapt these for your environment.)

- **Search for HTTP download of payload filename**
  - Look for web/proxy logs with `tkraw_Protected99.exe` or the exact filename in URLs.

- **Search for DNS query for suspicious domain**
  - Look for queries to `proforma-invoices.com` or similar invoice-like domains.

- **Search for repeated outbound SMTP**
  - Look for multiple SMTP sessions from a host to `sales.del@macwinlogistics.in` (repeat every ~10 minutes).

- **Search for suspicious PowerShell or command execution**
  - Look for encoded PowerShell, IEX, or suspicious download-execute patterns in endpoint logs.

---

## 5 — Triage checklist
1. Identify affected host(s) by hostname/IP and search logs for the filename and domain.  
2. Collect volatile evidence from the host (memory, running processes, network connections).  
3. Search for the payload on disk and match file hash.  
4. Pull mail gateway logs for outbound connections to the exfil email.  
5. Export PCAP snippets of the HTTP download and SMTP exfil for analysts.

---

## 6 — Containment actions (immediate)
- Isolate `BEIJING-5CD1-PC` from the network (NAC/quarantine).  
- Block `proforma-invoices.com` at DNS and firewall.  
- Block `sales.del@macwinlogistics.in` at mail gateway.  
- Quarantine the file hash in EDR/AV.  
- Start password reset for exposed users and enable MFA.

---

## 7 — Remediation & recovery
- Remove persistence and malware artifacts or rebuild the host if persistence can’t be fully removed.  
- Rotate compromised credentials & require MFA.  
- Scan other hosts for the same IOCs.  
- Tune SIEM alerts and implement saved searches for the above detections.

---

## 8 — Detection tuning notes
- Set saved alert for HTTP downloads of known bad filenames.  
- Create a correlation rule: trigger high priority when `HTTP download` **and** `Outbound SMTP to unknown recipient` happen from same host within 30 minutes.  
- Tune DNS alerts to ignore known harmless domains and reduce false positives.

> **Safety note:** Do not execute any samples. Only analyze or hash them in a safe environment.
