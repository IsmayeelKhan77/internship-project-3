# Purple Team Handover — HawkEye Lab
**Author:** Ismayeel khan
**Role:** Purple Team (Red + Blue handover)  
**Capture Date:** 2019-04-10

---

## 1 — Quick summary
Attacker downloaded `tkraw_Protected99.exe` from `proforma-invoices.com`. The malware collected credentials and exfiltrated them by email to `sales.del@macwinlogistics.in` every 10 minutes. Red Team captured the flow and IOCs; Blue Team created detection and containment steps. This is a short handover that connects both sides and lists the top priorities.

## 2 — Key findings (IOCs)
- Malicious domain: `proforma-invoices.com` (packet #204)  
- Malicious file: `tkraw_Protected99.exe`  
- File MD5: `71826ba081e303866ce2a2534491a2f7`  
- Exfil email: `sales.del@macwinlogistics.in`  
- Example stolen creds: `roman.mcguire:P@ssw0rd$`  
- Victim host: `BEIJING-5CD1-PC` (public IP: `173.66.146.112`)

## 3 — Attack → Defense summary
- **Attack step:** user visits an invoice domain → downloads an executable → malware collects creds → exfil via email every 10 minutes.  
- **Where defenders should look:** DNS logs (for domain), web/proxy logs (for file download), mail logs (for repeated SMTP to suspect email), endpoint logs (for suspicious process runs).  
- **Immediate defense:** block the domain and email, isolate the host, blacklist the file hash, rotate creds, and conduct a hunt for similar signs.

## 4 — Top prioritized actions (do these first)
1. Block `proforma-invoices.com` and `sales.del@macwinlogistics.in` at network/mail layers.  
2. Quarantine `BEIJING-5CD1-PC` and capture disk + memory images.  
3. Blacklist hash `71826ba081e303866ce2a2534491a2f7` in EDR.  
4. Rotate and secure exposed accounts; require MFA.  
5. Create SIEM alerts for filename downloads and repeated SMTP exfil patterns.  
6. Hunt the network for other similar hosts.

## 5 — What worked and what to improve
**Worked:** PCAP gave clear visibility; filename/domain detection was effective; periodic exfil was easy to spot.  
**Improve:** Add more endpoint telemetry (process creation, scheduled tasks), strengthen mail gateway rules to detect automated exfil, and prepare alerts that detect encrypted exfil strategies.

**End of handover.**  
If you want, I can now convert these into a single nicely formatted `README.md` overview or generate the `hashes.txt` contents you can drop into the `evidence/` folder.
